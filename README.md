# Neural Network Basics: Forward & Backward Pass Explained
🚀 A Beginner-Friendly Guide to Neural Networks

This repository provides a clear and concise introduction to the fundamentals of neural networks, specifically focusing on forward pass and backward pass calculations. Whether you're new to machine learning or looking for a simple yet effective way to understand the core concepts, this guide will help you connect the dots.

✔️ Step-by-Step Forward and Backward Pass – Learn how data flows through a neural network and how gradients are computed.

✔️ Single Data Point Example – Understand how neural networks process one example at a time.

✔️ Multiple Data Points Example – See how batch processing works for better generalization.

✔️ Feature Representation Variations – Some textbooks represent features as rows, while others use columns—this repo covers both!
